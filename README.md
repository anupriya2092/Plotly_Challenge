# Plotly_Challenge
Creating data visualizations and web page using Java script library Plotly.

## Purpose and Overview of the project
1. In this project we have used bootstrap and CSS to style our webpage and Plotly , which is a java script data visualization library to create interactive features for our webpage.
   The webpage link is provided below:
	
	https://anupriya2092.github.io/Plotly_Challenge/

2. To test the hypothesis that the bacterial species found in a person's belly button can be used to make synthetic beef, we have gathered samples from the belly button of people
   across the country. Each person is assigned a unique ID number.
   
3. The researchers can access these IDs to see what type of bacteria resides in their belly button and can further continue with this research.

4. Our webpage provides a drop down menu to select the ID number by the user. As soon as the user selects an Id , a demographic panel below will give all the information about 
   the specimen like the gender , locality , washing frequency and so on.
   
5. Also the webpage displays a bar graph to show the top ten bacteria species present in the specimen of the selected ID number.

6. A bubble chart gives the information about the bacterial species present and the size of each bubble marker represents the count of bacteria sample present in the belly
   button of a particular person or ID number selected.
   
7. The gauge chart displays the washing frequency of the selected person per week. It has maximum value of 10 and changes with each changing ID number.
